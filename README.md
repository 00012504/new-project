I have completed Web technology coursework which I have to do individually. I created the frond-end (presentation layer) of the website chosen about online courses which is IT of course. The website has different responsive HTML pages with different structures because nowadays the demand for IT professionals is very high. I have used as many as elements, tables, forms, visual effect on CSS. The aim of the website is to give more information about new modern jobs to kids and teenagers and teach kids and teenagers those IT via online and on campus. Besides, through this website, you can also choose your idol job and can learn it. I called this website “Galaxy tech – Coding school”. As you can see, teachers of our school are from UK. They are very quailed, intelligent and aware of the any kind of computer technologies. In categories section, you can find brief information about what kind of courses we have and how to submit your data in order to study our course. In services section, you can see that there are three main groups which are IT, web design and mobile/app development courses. Through my website kids, teenagers can find data about modern IT jobs and how to learn it. The average tuition can be seen also.
